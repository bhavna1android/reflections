When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A - whenever i ws using internet or when there is a pull request and want to add the code as it is. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A - because in some cases may be i dont want to save the changes in my remote repository as i m not sure with the changes that i have made is correct or not.
